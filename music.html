            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Throughout my adolescence I was convinced that I would become a rapper: I thought that the combination of having a style writing and my passion for music would be enough to make me a performer. </p>
<p>Spoiler alert: my introversion didn't agree. </p>
<p>Over time I tried to shift towards more technical roles in artistic production, such as graphic designer, beatmaker and sound engineer. Eventually, I accepted that I was forcing a path that wasn't suitable for me (and wasting a lot of time in the process). </p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am grateful for everything I have learned and the people I have met during this journey, but mostly, I still enjoy making beats as a hobby: this section is dedicated to that. </p>
