            <h2>Hi! My name is...</h2>
            <p>First thing first: legally, my name is Domenico Pisani.</p>
            <p>I was born on 14th July of 1997 in Molfetta as Domenico, Luca Pisani.</p>
            <p>In 2019, while sorting mandatory documents  to start working in the UK, due to an old italian law, I was obliged to renounce my second name after the the comma to receive a passport.</p>
            <p> While Domenico is my grandfather's name, handed down to me by tradition, Luca is the one my father choose: informally, I will always sign as Domenico L. Pisani.</p>
            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>As a child, like many of my generation in Italy (probably brainwashed by magazines and gadgets sold during that time), I was fascinated by ancient Egypt and dinosaurs. These interests, became joy in classifing, with first a focus on gems and minerals, then on dog breeds, finally flowing into collecting thanks to the discovery of Dragon Ball lamincards and Pok√©mon games. The card games parenthesis has not yet ended: Yu-Gi-Oh! and Duel Masters eventually led to Magic: The Gathering, a drug from which I do not feel the need to detox. Unknowingly, I honed my English skills through RPG Maker XP, Pokemon hack ROMs and Pewdiepie, becoming passionate about the creative side of game design.</p>
            <h2>Adolescence</h2>
            <p>Starting from the last year of elementary school and throughout middle school (for some reason), I hated math. I chose to pursue classical studies to minimize the mandatory hours of math as much as possible. Learning to play the guitar during middle school led me to download Fruity Loops in high school: during this period, after starting to write poetry and short stories, I began producing beats and writing music, convinced that I would become a rapper. After finishing high school, hating studying (for some reason) and, having accomplished nothing as a self-produced artist, I tried to dedicate myself to more marginal and technical roles in the creative industry by enrolling in a graphic design BA program.</p>
            <h2>Adulthood</h2>
            <p>However, after two years, I was unhappy with the limited technical opportunities due to outdated equipment in the public school system, and also disillusioned by the nepotistic workings within the artistic field (common to various fields in Italy). So, I decided to abandon my studies and country, finding a cabin crew position near London shortly thereafter. Still undecided and perhaps feeling remorse for abandoning creativity, I set aside money throughout this time to continue my education. However, I realized that continuing that job would not allow me to attend the courses I wanted. So, I resigned, convinced by a friend to try pursuing the artistic career again moving to Milan with him. It was March 2020: shortly after I found myself trapped and unemployed for two years at my parents' home due to the COVID lockdowns.</p>
            <h2>Covid and Career Switch</h2>
            <p>Despite being a difficult time, it was very productive in terms of introspection and life reorganization. I decided definitively to resume my studies to earn a degree that would allow me a future abroad (preferring Canada). During this period, there was a total paradigm shift in my thinking: feeling betrayed and disillusioned by the randomness of the arts, I increasingly relied on data: I analyzed market researchs, demanded professions in Canada, filtering through my interests what could afford me the greatest pay and happiness in the long run. Two fortunate events led me to choose psychology: first, I stumbled upon Jordan Peterson's personality psychology course on YouTube while searching for information about Canada and psychology, realizing how my diverse interests could be connected by a common interest in people, second, at the end of the year a university near me opened a course in psychology, which would enable me to study the subject.</p>
            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>Through my studies in research methods and psychometrics, I have discovered a previously dormant interest in psychology and have rekindled my interest in data and statistics. Given the challenges of directly pursuing my career in Canada (where a PhD is required to practice), my current goal is to gain admission to a Northern European university for an MSc in Work Psychology.</p>
