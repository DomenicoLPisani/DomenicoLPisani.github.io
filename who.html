            <h2>Short Autobiography</h2>
            <p>First of all, officially my name is Domenico Pisani. </p>
<p>I was born on 14/07/1997 in Molfetta (Bari, Apulia, Italy) by the name "Domenico, Luca Pisani". In 2019, while renewing my ID to work in the UK, I was forced to remove my second name after the comma due to a 2001 law to avoid changing my document identification number, which would have caused bureaucratic procedures and made me lose my job. Domenico is my grandfather's name, which tradition dictates is mine, while Luca is the name my father would have liked to give me: unofficially, I always sign my name as Domenico L. Pisani. </p>
<p>As a child, like many others of my generation in Italy, I was fascinated by Egypt and dinosaurs but was not interested in WWE and motorsports. Later, I discovered Dragonball and its laminated cards, which led to an obsession with card games, resulting in an unhealed addiction to Magic the Gathering. Until 2008, my father owned a record store where I grew up surrounded by old school music and videogames. Unknowingly, I honed my English skills through RPG Maker XP, Pokemon hack ROMs and Pewdiepie, becoming passionate about the creative side of game design. </p>
<p>Starting from the last year of elementary school and throughout middle school (for some reason), I hated math. I chose to pursue classical studies to minimize the mandatory hours of math as much as possible. Learning to play the guitar during middle school led me to download Fruity Loops in high school: during this period, after starting to write poetry and short stories, I began producing beats and writing music, convinced that I would become a rapper. After finishing high school, hating studying (for some reason) and, having accomplished nothing as a self-produced artist, I tried to dedicate myself to more marginal and technical roles in the creative industry by enrolling in a graphic design BA program. 
<p>However, after two years, I was unhappy with the limited technical opportunities due to outdated equipment in the public school system. I was also disillusioned by the nepotistic workings within the artistic field, which were common to various fields in the Italian state. So, I decided to abandon my studies and country, finding a cabin crew position near London shortly thereafter. Still undecided and perhaps feeling remorse for abandoning art, I set aside money throughout this time to continue my education. However, I realized that continuing that job would not allow me to attend the courses I wanted. So, I resigned and was convinced by a friend to try the artistic career again by both of us moving to Milan. It was March 2020, and shortly thereafter, I became trapped and unemployed for two years at my parents' home due to the COVID lockdown. </p>
<p>Despite being a difficult time, it was very productive in terms of introspection and reorganization. I decided definitively to resume my studies to earn a degree that would allow me a future abroad, preferably in Canada, a country where I have always wanted to live. During this period, there was a total paradigm shift in my thinking: feeling betrayed and disillusioned by the randomness of the arts, I increasingly relied on data analysis and statistics. I analyzed the market research of large companies and the professions demanded in Canada. I filtered out what might interest me, and the research led me to psychology. Two fortunate events led me to choose this path: first, I stumbled upon Jordan Peterson's Personality Psychology course on YouTube while searching for information about Canada and psychology, realizing how my diverse interests could be connected by a common interest in people, second, at the end of the year a university near me opened a course in psychology, which would enable me to study the subject. </p>
<p>Through my studies in research methods and psychometrics, I have discovered a previously dormant interest in psychology and have rekindled my interest in data and statistics.
Given the challenges of directly pursuing my career in Canada (where a PhD is required to practice), my current goal is to gain admission to a Northern European university for an MSc in Work Psychology. </p>
